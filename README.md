### A study of the prices of musical instruments in Sri Lanka

## Context
The Dataset contains the prices of Music Instruments sold in Sri Lanka. Music instrument-related data sources are rare and that is why created this dataset. I wanted to create this dataset so that all the data scientists out there could easily use this in their projects. The process of data collection when done manually is very tedious and is a boring process especially when there are thousands of data points. I wrote an automated script to scrape new data so that I can keep the dataset up to date.

## Acknowledgements
The data is scraped from Sri Lanka's most famous online marketplace: Ikman.lk. The Credit for all the information goes to Ikman. This Dataset is just a tool for all the Data Scientists out there interested in inferring something more out of the data.

## Inspiration
It would be great if we could create machine learning models to better identify trends in music instrument prices in Sri Lanka. It is also nice if we could create Data Dashboards with help of software like Tableau and Power BI. The opportunities are limitless!

## Future
In the future, I will try expanding the spatial diversity of the dataset into other countries. Till then happy hacking with this dataset.

## Finally, I would be very happy if this dataset could bring a positive impact on your life or your workflow. And cheers!!!
